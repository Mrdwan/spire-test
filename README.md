this is a test task for Spire Company

# Installation steps
- Create a Mysql database "spire-test" for example

- Open services/db.php in any editor
- Add your database name, mysql username and password
- Ppen index.php file in PHP environment (e.g: valet)

# room for imporvements
there is a room for imporvements but for the sake of time and because this is a test task i didn't do it like:
- .env file to store database credentials
- QueryBuilder class for DB queries
- Extracting the View file into smaller components 
- Making Router and create routes but the app is to small so not needed
- Making controller instead of plain php file but app is too small for that
